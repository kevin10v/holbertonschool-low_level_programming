Using argc and argv to control program behavior

2. doubly_linked_lists

Creating and managing doubly linked lists

Insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions

3. file_io

File handling with system calls: open, read, write, close

Working with file descriptors and permissions

4. function_pointers

Declaring and using pointers to functions

Callback functions and dynamic function calls

5. functions_nested_loops

Defining and using functions in C

Using nested loops for repetitive tasks

6. hash_tables

Implementing hash tables with arrays and linked lists

Collision handling using chaining

7. hello_world

First C programs using printf and puts

Introduction to compiling with gcc

8. malloc_free

Dynamic memory allocation using malloc

Freeing allocated memory with free

9. more_functions_nested_loops
