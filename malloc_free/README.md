MALLOC_FREE

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate dynamic memory allocation using malloc and proper memory deallocation using free.

Files

0-create_array.c
Creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific char.

1-strdup.c
Returns a pointer to a newly allocated duplicate of a given string.

2-str_concat.c
Concatenates two strings into newly allocated memory.

3-alloc_grid.c
Returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers (grid).

4-free_grid.c
Frees a 2D grid previously created by alloc_grid.

main.h
Header file containing function prototypes.

Learning Objectives

Understand dynamic memory allocation in C.

Allocate memory for arrays, strings, and 2D arrays.

Free allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

Use pointers to manage dynamically allocated memory.
