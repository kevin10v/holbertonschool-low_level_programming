HOLBERTONSCHOOL - LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING 💻🔧

Welcome to the Low-Level Programming in C repository!
This project contains multiple submodules covering fundamental and advanced C programming concepts, from basic syntax to complex data structures and algorithms.
It is part of the Holberton School curriculum, designed to build strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how computers work at a low level.

Learning Objectives 🎯

By completing this repository, you will:

Master the C programming language syntax and structure.

Work with pointers, memory allocation, and arrays.

Understand control flow using loops and conditional statements.

Manipulate strings and files using system calls.

Implement and manage data structures like linked lists, hash tables, and structures.

Apply recursion to solve problems.

Use function pointers and variadic functions.

Write clean, maintainable code following Betty coding style.

Requirements 📌

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All code compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4

Compilation flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic

Follow Betty coding style

Use only allowed functions for each project

Include header files where needed

Project Structure 📂
1. argc_argv 🖥️

Learn how to handle command-line arguments using argc and argv.

2. doubly_linked_lists 🔄

Create and manipulate doubly linked lists with bidirectional traversal.

3. file_io 📂

Perform file input/output operations using low-level system calls (open, read, write, close).

4. function_pointers 🎯

Use pointers to functions for callbacks and dynamic function execution.

5. functions_nested_loops 🔁

Practice writing functions and using nested loops to solve problems.

6. hash_tables 🗂️

Implement hash tables for efficient key-value data storage and retrieval.

7. hello_world 👋

Introduction to C programming: first scripts, compilation process, and printing text.

8. malloc_free 💾

Learn dynamic memory allocation with malloc and proper deallocation with free.

9. more_functions_nested_loops ➿

Advanced exercises with functions and nested loops.

10. more_malloc_free 🧮

Advanced memory management using calloc, realloc, and free.

11. pointers_arrays_strings 🔤

Work with pointers, arrays, and strings for data manipulation.

12. recursion 🔄

Implement recursive functions for various problems.

13. singly_linked_lists 📋

Work with singly linked lists: creation, traversal, insertion, and deletion.

14. structures_typedef 🏷️

Define and use struct data types and simplify them with typedef.

15. variables_if_else_while 🔢

Basic C syntax with variables, conditional statements, and loops.

16. variadic_functions ➕

Create functions that accept a variable number of arguments using stdarg.h.
